# SNHU_Project3
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving…… The grocery store needs to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers.
What did you do particularly well?..... I felt comfortable in the script that passed information back and forth from Python to C++.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?..... If I had the opportunity to enhance this project, I would limit the amount of functions used and attempt to make the list into Python more efficient
.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?..... The most challenging part of this project was integrating both Python and C++. The resources used were those found in SNHU and assistance from the student network.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? The  ability to integrate two separate languages. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?..... I labeled my code throughout the project so I can easily pick up where I left off and make it easy for others to understand my thought process and read the code easily
